<h2>F.R.I.E.N.D.S recommender system based on Twitter</h2>

<p>F.R.I.E.N.D.S recommender system consists of customized selection (based on user preference) as well as machine learning recommendation. It can capture users' personality (MBTI), interest, network, and location. We even add some fun to the system by showing the recommendation level (70%, 90%), the common interest/topic, and the most frequently used emoji/words.</p>
